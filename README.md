# Momentum v3-Core (Sui / Move)

Core smart contracts for **Momentum DEX v3**, a Uniswap-v3–style CLMM (concentrated liquidity market maker) implemented in **Move** on **Sui**.  
This repo contains the on-chain building blocks used by Momentum’s DEX and related components (e.g., slippage checking).

> For high-level product docs and concepts, see the [Momentum Developer Docs](https://docs.mmt.finance/core-products/momentum-dex/developers).  
> For the official TypeScript SDK, see [`@mmt-finance/clmm-sdk`](https://github.com/mmt-finance/clmm-sdk).  
> For low-level contract interfaces used by integrators, see [`mmt-contract-interface`](https://github.com/mmt-finance/mmt-contract-interface).

## Packages & features

This repo currently ships two Move packages:

- **`clmm/`** – Core CLMM protocol: pools, positions, ticks, swap/quote, fees, and liquidity accounting.
- **`slippage_check/`** – Pure-function helpers to verify minimum-out / maximum-in constraints off-path and on-chain. Useful for routers, frontends, MEV-safe flows, and risk control.

## Prerequisites

- **Sui CLI** (matching your localnet/testnet version).  
  Install from Sui’s official releases and ensure `sui` is on your PATH.
- **Move toolchain** (bundled with Sui).
- **Node.js 18+** & **Yarn** (for formatting scripts / CI only).
- A **Sui account** with gas (for testnet/devnet).

> If you’re integrating from an app/service, you’ll usually pair these contracts with the [`@mmt-finance/clmm-sdk`](https://github.com/mmt-finance/clmm-sdk) TypeScript library.

## Build, test & deploy

sui move test --path slippage_check

# Deploy
sui client publish --path clmm
sui client publish --path slippage_check
```
